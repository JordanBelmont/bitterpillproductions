         Profile: Jordan Belmont has had art and creativity coursing through his veins for as long as he can remember.
         From doodling in his school text books to achieving his degree at art college, a pencil has always been close
         to his hand, and his heart.
         Inspired by everything from 80s cartoons and computer games to glam metal music and propaganda war posters, his
         creations serve as a retrospective of someone who has experienced an enriched upbringing where ingenuity and
         imagination has been encouraged.
         Jordan has gone on to specialise in traditional and digital illustration as well as professional level
         copywriting. He has a strong love for keeping fit and healthy, binge watching HBO shows, and admits his biggest
         weakness is that he only has two hands with which to satiate his creative hunger.
         He also has a tendency to write about himself in the third person.
