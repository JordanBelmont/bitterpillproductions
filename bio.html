            PROFILE:
            <br>
            <br>
            Jordan Belmont has had art and creativity coursing through his veins for as long as he can
            remember. From doodling in his school text books to achieving his degree at art college, a pencil has always been
            close to his hand, and his heart.<br>
            <br>
            Inspired by everything from 80s cartoons and computer games to glam metal music and propaganda war
            posters, his creations serve as a retrospective of someone who has experienced an enriched upbringing where ingenuity and imagination has been encouraged.<br>
            <br>
            Jordan has gone on to specialise in traditional and digital illustration as well as professional level
            copywriting. He has a strong love for keeping fit and healthy, binge watching HBO shows, and admits his
            biggest weakness is that he only has two hands with which to satiate his creative hunger.
            He also has a tendency to write about himself in the third person.<br>
